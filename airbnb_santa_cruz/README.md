# Santa Cruz Airbnb Visualization
Using [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), I've create a visualization of the Airbnb rentals that are available in Santa Cruz county. 
![Screenshot of Visual](sc_airbnb_vis.png)
## Description
The sand colored points are entire house/apartment rentals, the brown are private rooms, and the other are unclassified. Hovering over a point gives you the available data about the rental.
## Styling
Beyond the coloring there isn't really any styling for the visual.
